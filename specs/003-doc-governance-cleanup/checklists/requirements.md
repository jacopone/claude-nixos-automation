# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Governance and Cleanup System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**: Specification focuses on user value (GitHub star optimization, development efficiency) and business needs (documentation debt reduction). Written in plain language describing WHAT users need, not HOW to implement it.

**Requirements**: All 27 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Examples:
- FR-003: "Frontmatter schema MUST exactly match nixos-config" - Verifiable via schema diff
- FR-002: "Root directory contains exactly 3-5 files" - Verifiable via `ls | wc -l`
- FR-006: "100% of markdown files have frontmatter" - Verifiable via grep count

**Success Criteria**: All 8 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-004: "<10 second value comprehension" - User testing metric
- SC-005: "80% documentation debt reduction" - File count metric
- SC-006: "100% frontmatter coverage" - grep-based validation

**Acceptance Scenarios**: Each user story has 2-4 Given/When/Then scenarios that can be independently tested without knowing implementation.

**Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases identified covering error handling, missing directories, merge conflicts, and cross-repository safety.

**Dependencies**: Clearly documented (Python 3.6+, git, pre-commit framework, bash)

**Scope**: Out-of-scope section prevents scope creep (8 items explicitly excluded)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements have sensible defaults documented in Assumptions section
- Feature can be implemented independently in phases matching the 5 user stories (P1, P1, P2, P3, P2 priorities)

# Specification Quality Checklist: Code Quality Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

**Notes**:
- Specification is comprehensive and well-structured
- All user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- Requirements are specific and measurable
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- Edge cases are well-documented with mitigation strategies
- Scope is clearly defined with explicit in-scope/out-of-scope boundaries
- No clarifications needed - all details are specified or use reasonable industry-standard defaults
